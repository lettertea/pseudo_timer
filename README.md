**A WCA/Google knockoff timer and scramble generator.**

[Website](https://pseudotimer.netlify.com/)

This website is meant to log times and their averages for WCA event solves. It uses the scrambling code in [v0.14.0](https://github.com/thewca/tnoodle/releases/tag/v0.14.0) of the official WCA scramble program, [TNoodle](https://github.com/thewca/tnoodle). It also attempts to look like [Google](https://www.google.com/), giving me a better excuse to call it "Pseudo Timer" than just not being able to come up with a better name.
